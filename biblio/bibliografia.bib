   abstract = {The potential for mapping of turbidity in inland and coastal waters using imagery from the PlanetScope (PS) and RapidEye (RE) constellations is evaluated. With >120 PS and 5 RE satellites in orbit these constellations are able to provide metre scale imagery on a daily basis and could significantly enhance high spatial resolution monitoring of turbidity worldwide. The Dark Spectrum Fitting (DSF) atmospheric correction is adapted to the PS and RE imaging systems to retrieve surface reflectances. Due to the large amount of imagery and the limited band sets on these sensors, automated pixel classification is required. This is here performed using a neural network approach, which is able to classify water pixels for clear to moderately turbid waters. Due to the limited band set and sensor performance, some issues remain with classifying extremely turbid waters and cloud shadows based on a spectral approach. Surface reflectance data compares well with in situ measurements from the AERONET-OC network. Turbidity is estimated from the Red, RedEdge (RE only) and NIR bands and is compared with measurements from autonomous stations in the San Francisco Bay area and the coastal waters around the United Kingdom. Good performance is found for Red band derived turbidity from PS data, while the NIR band performance is mediocre, likely due to calibration issues. For RE, all three turbidity products give reasonable results. A high revisit density allows for the mapping of temporal variability in water turbidity using these satellite constellations. Thanks to the RedEdge band on RE, chlorophyll a absorption can be avoided, and perhaps even estimated.},

   abstract = {The dark spectrum fitting (DSF) atmospheric correction method for aquatic application of metre-scale resolution optical satellite imagery is adapted to Landsat and Sentinel-2 (L/S2), including an automated tiled processing of full scene imagery and an optional image based glint correction. The DSF uses multiple dark targets in the subscene to construct a “dark spectrum” which is used to estimate the atmospheric path reflectance (ρ path ) according to the best fitting aerosol model. This method is fully automated and can be used for full mission archive processing, as demonstrated here for a study region in the North Sea. The new approach overcomes common issues with the SWIR based exponential extrapolation approach (EXP). An evaluation of both methods is presented using L w measurements from 19 sites in the AERONET-OC network over a 15 year period and 5 satellite sensors. Overall, the DSF performs better than the EXP, with a notable improvement in the blue spectral region. The tiled processing allows for a smooth ρ path estimation for full and merged L/S2 scenes, over clear and turbid coastal waters, inland waters, and land. The DSF selects the most appropriate band automatically, i.e. the one giving the lowest atmospheric path reflectance, and hence largely avoids amplification of glint and adjacency effects in the atmospheric correction. After application of the DSF, sun glint reflectance can be estimated from the SWIR bands, and the application of a sun glint correction significantly improves data availability for these nadir viewing sensors. A consistent processing across sensors allows for the exploitation of the >30 year L/S2 archive, including Landsat 5 imagery dating back to 1984. A practical application of the DSF and the L/S2 archive is presented, where the remotely sensed water turbidity from 5 satellites is compared with in situ measurements from a long-term (2000–present) monitoring station in the southern North Sea.},

@article{Vanhellemont2018,
   abstract = {A new atmospheric correction (AC) method for aquatic application of metre-scale resolution (MR) optical satellite imagery is presented in this article, and demonstrated using images from the Pléiades constellation. MR satellites are typically operated privately and imagery can be costly. However in recent years, the price of individual acquisitions has dropped and their revisit times have improved, making them promising tools for remote sensing of inland and coastal waters. Due to the spatial resolution requirements of these satellites, the bands on the sensors are relatively wide (60–140 nm on Pléiades) in order to achieve an acceptable signal to noise ratio. This bandwidth and the limited number of bands can pose problems for the AC as the water signal may not be negligible in any band, especially over turbid waters. Since the MR sensors have a relatively narrow swath (20 km for Pléiades) the atmosphere can generally be assumed to be homogeneous over a scene or subscene. This assumption allows the atmospheric path reflectance (ρpath) to be estimated from multiple targets in the scene, which are selected according to the lowest observed top-of-atmosphere reflectances (ρTOA) in all bands. Rather than using pre-defined “dark” bands (e.g. in the NIR and SWIR) such as is common in other water-focused AC methods, the best band is selected automatically, i.e. the one yielding the lowest ρpath. This criterion avoids unrealistic negative (“overcorrected”) reflectances after the AC. Furthermore, for inland waters the NIR bands are usually affected by scattering from adjacent land and vegetation pixels, resulting in unrealistic ρpath when used in the AC. The spatial resolution of the sensors is used as an advantage here, since ground-level object shadows (e.g. from trees and buildings) can be spatially resolved and are usually the pixels selected by the automated procedure for the determination of ρpath. In fact, it is proposed that using these shadow pixels gives better performance than using any kind of water pixel for these broad-band MR sensors. The method is demonstrated using several Pléiades images, showing good performance in retrieval of the aerosol optical thickness (τa) for an urban (Brussels) and a coastal (Zeebrugge) site. Match-ups with water reflectances measured at the Zeebrugge AERONET-OC station show promising performance, although there is a significant spectral mismatch between the bands on the satellites and the CIMEL radiometer. Pléiades imagery of Zeebrugge reveals a turbid wake associated with the MOW1 measurement station, which opens perspectives of using MR satellites for the characterisation of monitoring and validation sites. Future work includes the application to other MR satellites (e.g. WorldView) and the evaluation for mass processing of open access high resolution (10–60 m) satellite data from Landsat and Sentinel-2.},

The effect of the Paraguay on water and suspended sediment discharges was examined. The Paraguay River contribution explains most of the variation in channel conditions upstream and downstream of the confluence. The channel pattern, however, remains braided. The high bed load of the Paraná River in proportion to the total sediment discharge (21% in the upper course, 25% in the middle course) determines the similarity in drainage. D},

   abstract = {Reducing uncertainty and productive risk increase the resilience of agricultural systems and food security of a region. While crop productivity strongly depends on weather conditions during the growing season, El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon is the main driver of global interannual climate variability and affects crop production in many regions. The ENSO, Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) impact on corn and soybean yields between 1973 and 2017 was compared in Córdoba Province, Argentina, looking for an early signal to support agricultural activity. The analysis suggests that not only ENSO signal (SOI and SST El Niño 3.4) but also PDO anomaly (PDOA) link better than IOD with productivity for both crops, as well as the Southern Oscillation Index of August and September (SOIas) is a proper yield predictor. An inverse relationship was determined between SOIas and yields anomaly, more spread territorially for soybeans since the linear functions are significant (p < 0.05) in 9 of the 12 administrative areas and, with a slightly lower significance (p < 0.1), in the remaining too. On the other hand, the low R2 values indicate little capacity to explain the yield interannual variability from the SOIas signal that for corn, has a departmental range between 2 % and 19 % and, for soybeans, slightly higher between 7 % and 24 %. While the mean difference test of yield anomaly between different ENSO phases (El Niño, La Niña and Neutral) supports the more general indifference of both extreme phases with the neutral cases, it reaches a significant character in 8 departments when the cold phase is compared with the warm. The seasonal rainfall regime has also a reduced capacity to explain productive variability. However, this information is useful to realize that both the wettest (El Niño) and the driest years (La Niña) fail to differentiate from those with normal rainfall. This confusion was verified by a combinatory frequency analysis of rainfall and productivity data related to the ENSO phases. Because ENSO allows anticipating the rainfall condition and the productive potential of the main rain-fed crops in Córdoba, Argentina, it constitutes appropriate information to reduce uncertainty and the risk level in agricultural production. Therefore, although the ENSO predictive capacity is limited and more knowledge about the influence of other climatic variability sources like PDO is needed, its incorporation into a climate monitoring protocol must conforms to the basis of an early warning system for a sustainable agriculture in the region.},

   abstract = {This study examines the effects of the flow and flood pulses on spatial dispersion of fish assemblages in the floodplain of the Paraná River in Argentina. We tested the hypothesis that high water levels and greater lateral connectivity promote fish dispersal and spatial homogenization of assemblage structure. We sampled four sites during different phases of the annual hydrologic cycle from 2010 to 2016. Water surface in the area was estimated during each phase. We computed multivariate statistics and estimates of ß-diversity to analyse assemblage variations in relation to hydrological phases. Three hydrological phases were defined: low flow pulses (water levels between 2.3 and 3.2, approximately 10% of the floodplain covered by water), high flow pulses (between 3.2 and 4.5, from 11 to 84%), and floods (> 4.5 m, more than 84%). Although difference between high flow pulses and flood was not significant, ß-diversity values for these stages were higher than for low flow pulses. This suggests that floods and high flow pulses increase the spatial variability of fish assemblages, whereas homogenization processes occur later during low flow periods. This work provides further knowledge about the flood homogenization effect in a large unregulated floodplain where lateral connectivity still plays a significant role on ecological structuring processes.},

In this work, we propose the bases for assessing the ecohydrological changes resulting from direct and indirect
human activities at a regional scale in Argentina. The climatic, morphological and geological diversity of the
territory is manifested in different ecoregions and in a high diversity of lotic and lentic environments which
are closely linked to the water systems. Daily flows, groundwater levels, flooded surfaces or hydrometric
heights have different influences depending on the ecoregion considered in each water system. The historical
hydrological information with continuity and records with a sufficient extension for the analysis of the alterations
of the hydrological regime are relatively scarce and restricted to 163 measuring stations. The application of a
conceptual model for the analysis of hydrological alterations is proposed, followed by the study of temporal
variations in the hydrological and morphological conditions prior to the anthropic activity (pre-impact), to
then consider the new hydrological-ecological situation (post-impact), on the basis of which appropriate
measures should be adopted to mitigate the ecological damage when they occur. Although there are various
methodologies to conduct this analysis, considering the availability of current data in Argentina, we propose
the use of the methodological framework based on the ELOHA (Ecological Limit of Hydrological Alteration)
concept for the analysis of hydrological alterations. Although the holistic method provides the best results and
the least uncertainty, considering the heterogeneity, scarcity and lack of continuity of hydrological records
at a general level, the proposed technique could be a good approximation at a regional scale. It is concluded
that it will be necessary to adapt the methodological bases and analysis techniques to this condition in order
to create a database for the strategic planning of water resources in Argentina.},

During the sampling program in the summer of 1970, we measured relative H2180/H2160 abundances in cross-sectional profiles of this same system in order to elucidate the mixing phenomena. The basic principle of this approach is that isotopic species of water possess different vapor pressures. Consequently, the world meteorological system acts as a complex still which effectively fractionates (alters the relative abundances of) isotopic species of water. Although the isotopic composition of precipitation at any location depends on a number of factors, temperature seems to be the most important parameter (Dansgaard 1964). Since the oceans of the world are fairly uniform isotopically, relative abundances of isotopic species of water are expressed in terms of a hypothetical water stand-lPresent address:},

   abstract = {This paper discusses the geological evolution of the Paraná River in Corrientes Province, located inside the Mesopotamic Argentine region, and reviews the principal geomorphological and hydro-sedimentological characteristics of this outstanding fluvial system. Active lateral migration of the Paraná River inside its large alluvial fan, which covers the north-western portion of Corrientes Province, reveals a structural control related to the separation and breakup of Gondwana. The lowlands now present in this region receive only pluvial input and constitute one of the largest wetlands in South America, the Esteros del Iberá. The best exposed geological units in Corrientes Province are the Ituzaingó Formation (Plio-Pleistocene) that is a fluvial deposit associated with evolution of the Paraná River, and the Toropí-Yupoí Formation (Pleistocene), a younger palustrine fill generated by deposition of aeolian sediment over the underlying fluvial sands. The present planform pattern of the Paraná River in Corrientes Province is anabranching with several types of bar that occupy more than 30% of the channel surface. The bed sediment is predominantly medium to fine sand with the dominant bedform being dunes, which thus also dominate its subsurface sedimentary architecture. The suspended sediment concentration of the Paraná River downstream from its confluence with the Paraguay River (its main tributary) is asymmetric across the channel width, with higher concentrations towards the west due to the much higher input of sediment from the Paraguay River, which in turn receives most of its suspended sediment from the Bermejo River. At Corrientes City, suspended sediment concentration shows extremes ranging from 1 to 616 mg L−1 on the eastern margin and from 8 to 1271 mg L−1 on the western margin. Mixing between the Paraná and Paraguay rivers flows may take more than 600 km downstream before full mixing is achieved, with the mixing processes at the junction being determined by the discharge (momentum) ratio between the two confluent rivers, topographically-driven flows and the possible influence of density driven underflows at their interface. The confluence area between the Paraná and Paraguay rivers is characterized by a large scour that is ∼30 m deep, with its deepest location being at the mouth of the Paraguay River where the channel narrows due to local bedrock control. Due to the different elevation of the Paraná River margins in the region downstream of the confluence, the contemporary floodplain is developed extensively only on the western margin. This floodplain can also be considered as proximal (flooded yearly) or distal (flooded only during extraordinary events) in its geomorphic character. Most of the headwaters of small tributaries in this part of the Paraná River basin are located in wetlands. In these wetlands, the channel beds are characterized by fine sediment consisting of silt and cohesive clays, and where the suspended sediment has a high proportion of organic matter.},

The higher frequencies of the precipitation variability (2.5-4 years) favored extreme events after 2000, even during moderate extreme phases of the ENSO. Minimum temperature is correlated with ENSO with a main frequency close to 3 years. Maximum temperature time series correlate well with SST variability over the South Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans with a 9-year frequency. Interdecadal variability is characterized by low-frequency trends and multidecadal oscillations that have induced a transition from dryer and cooler climate to wetter and warmer decades starting in the mid-twentieth century. The Paraná River streamflow is influenced by North and South Atlantic SSTs with bidecadal periodicities. The hydroclimate variability at all timescales had significant sectoral impacts. Frequent wet events between 1970 and 2005 favored floods that affected agricultural and livestock productivity and forced population displacements. On the other hand, agricultural droughts resulted in soil moisture deficits that affected crops at critical growth stages. Hydrological droughts affected surface water resources, causing water and food scarcity and stressing the capacity for hydropower generation. Lastly, increases in minimum temperature reduced wheat and barley yields.},

The main objective of this study is to assess the relationship between climatic variability events (El Niño Southern Oscillation, ENSO), land use and shallow lakes’ areal variations in the temperate plains of Argentina for the period 2002–2011. The standard precipitation evaporation index (SPEI) was employed in this study in conjunction with the oceanic Niño index (ONI) and in situ annual precipitation data to determine wet, dry and normal years. Shallow lakes’ areal variation was analyzed by satellite imagery (MODIS) processing and the variability of the land use intensity was determined based on agricultural estimations. Frequency in the maximum of shallow lake areas was relatively more dependent on any changes in the rainfall regime (ENSO events) than in the land use (decrease/increase of the cultivated area). The El Niño (2002/3) and La Niña (2007/8) events clearly affected the precipitations of the total studied lake regions, with maximum areas in 2002 and minimum in 2008. The results obtained may be an important contribution to mitigate flooding and droughts in the studied area.},

   abstract = {We used a dam-free tributary (the Baía River) in the upper Paraná River floodplain downstream of a major dam in the Paraná River, Brazil to investigate the effects of dam-regulated reverse flow on limnological variables and fish. We tested the hypotheses that limnological variables in tributaries change based on flow direction and that fish assemblages respond to this variation. Sampling sites were determined considering flow direction (normal or reverse) and position (near or far from the river mouth). Limnological variables showed higher values for transparency, oxygen, pH, and electrical conductivity at sites near the mouth of the Baía River during reverse flow. Species richness and evenness differed significantly in relation to position, with higher values closer to the Paraná River. The average standard length of fish species was higher near the mouth of the Baía River and during the reverse flow period. No significant differences in species abundance were found. Reverse flow into the Baía River brought nutrient-poor water from the dammed Paraná River, thereby altering the limnological variables. This flow condition impelled the entry of species with higher average standard lengths. However, increased species richness and low evenness were due to the increase in species dispersal rates under all flow conditions. Our results emphasize that the effects of dams can extend several kilometres into the floodplain, provide basic knowledge on the effects of major dams on downstream pristine tributaries, and highlight the need for further studies to understand the wider influences.},

It is clear, however, that the incidence of interannual climatic anomalies is not uniform in time and appears embedded in decadal or quasi bidecadal periods of relative damming inactivity. The use of nonparametric tests shows that there are no significant positive trends in the river's annual discharge with the only exception of the yearly snowmelt/ice melt periods (September-October), when riverine flow appears to increase with statistical significance. The question of the glacier's stability looks like a complex multivariate process, although we do not rule out the occasional role of ENSO/AAO. A longer hydrological data series (i.e., 100. years) would prove useful in casting some light on this intriguing process, surely accounting for the glacier's response time. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

During mixing, substantial amounts of < 0.063 mm sediment are lost from suspension. The water closest to the left bank appears to lose the most, probably by deposition onto the floodplain. This occurs in two ways. First, sediment‐laden left‐bank tributaries draining the Andes, such as the Apure, deposit sediment in distributary systems following impoundment by the Orinoco backwater. Second, when sediment‐laden waters from the Andes actually join the Orinoco, the slow nature of cross‐channel mixing causes the water and sediment to be confined more to the left side of the channel. Significant sediment loss or storage probably occurs only near flood stage. Since sedimentation occurs preferentially on the left (Andean foreland basin) bank, the Orinoco remains stably situated on the border of the foreland basin with the Guayana shield.

   abstract = {Airborne and satellite observations show that when large rivers join they can take hundreds of kilometers to mix completely but, on occasion, may mix very rapidly. Application of established semitheoretical analyses shows that long mixing lengths should be expected. The first measurements of mixing processes at a large river junction (Río Paraná and Río Paraguay, Argentina, combined width ∼2.8 km) are presented at two occasions: first when they mix in >400 km, and second when mixing is complete in only 8 km downstream of the junction. For the case of slower mixing, at-a-point surveys showed that mixing driven by turbulent shear associated with a near-vertical shear layer was restricted to close to the junction (to 0.272 multiples of the postconfluence width downstream). Transect surveys showed penetration of more turbid water from the Río Paraguay underneath the Río Paraná, but this was insufficient to promote more rapid mixing. There was no clear channel-scale circulation present and slow mixing was compounded by reverse topographic forcing on the mainstream Río Paraná side of the river. This kept more turbid water on the Río Paraguay side of the river, close to the bed. In the case of rapid mixing, we found clear channel-scale circulation. The momentum ratio between the combining flows reinforced the effects of the discordance in bed height between the tributaries at the confluence and allowed penetration of more turbid Río Paraguay water further across the channel width deeper within the flow. The importance of the interaction between momentum ratio and bed morphology at channel junctions makes mixing rates at the confluence dependent upon basin-scale hydrological response, which is more likely to differ between large confluent rivers than small rivers, as a result of the different climatic/topographic zones that they may capture.

   abstract = {In this paper, the sediment budget at the conuence of the Paraná-Paraguay Rivers is updated on the basis of new suspended sediment concentration data, obtained during the 1990s at carefully located cross-sections, after the construction of several large reservoirs. With these data, it was possible to estimate that the suspended sediment load transported by the Upper Paraná River had decreased by 60% due to the inuence of the dams. This decrease occurred in spite of the inuence of climate change across the Upper Paraná and Paraguay basin, which increased the precipitation and surface runoff. As a consequence of these anthropogenic and natural processes, the Bermejo River (the main source of wash load to the system) accounts for an increasing proportion of the sediment transport along the middle and lower reaches of the Paraná River.TheParaná River currently transports about 120 * 106 t year-1 of wash load, with nearly 90% of this being supplied by the Bermejo. The contribution from the Bermejo is now about 35% larger than its contribution during the 1970s, when it accounted for approximately 60% of the sediment load of the Paraná River. These changes that have occurred over the last 30 years have enhanced the natural asymmetrical distribution of solid and water discharges in the Paraná River basin.

   abstract = {Changes in climate extremes affect socioeconomics and natural systems in northeastern Argentina (NEA) and may increase its vulnerability leading to unprecedented disasters. This study investigates the long-term changes and interannual variability of daily temperature and precipitation climate extremes and assesses to what extent global reanalyses reproduce the observed variability in the recent past. Datasets include quality-controlled observations (1963–2013) and ERA-Interim and NCEP2 reanalyses (1979–2011). Climate extremes are characterized spatially and temporally by 15 indices proposed by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices. The leading modes of the area-averaged index time series were obtained by means of a Singular Spectrum Analysis, while the spatial distribution of mean changes was estimated by fitting nonparametric linear trends to each index time series. The results show that temperature extremes are changing towards warmer conditions. The number of warm days has been increasing since 1990 while the number of cold days has been decreasing. Warm and cold nights show a significant signal of warming that seems to be stabilizing in recent decades. Heat waves almost double the frequency and duration of cold waves, and the duration of heat waves increased while cold spells decreased in last decades. Longer heat waves are related to longer dry spells. On the other hand, the number of frost days remained stable although they exhibit high interannual and decadal variability. As well, intense precipitation events in most of the region increased steadily since 1970. The annual maximum amount of 1-day and 5-day precipitation events increased from the 1970s to the 2000s, stabilizing in recent years. The ERA-Interim and NCEP2 reanalyses represent climate extremes with different success. ERA-Interim can recognize temperature extremes in time and space, while the older NCEP2 presents systematic positive errors and has some difficult to replicate the interannual variability of the number of summer days. Both reanalyses reproduce dry spells and the annual maximum 5-day precipitation with large biases, which are particularly noticeable at each observation station. Although reanalyses would be expected to add information for climate extremes in areas of scarce observations like northeastern Argentina, they still need to be used with great caution and only as a complement to observations, especially in studies focusing on precipitation extremes.},

  abstract = {Optical earth observation (EO) satellite sensors generally suffer from drifts and biases relative to their pre-launch calibration, caused by launch and/or time in the space environment. This places a severe limitation on the fundamental reliability and accuracy that can be assigned to satellite derived information, and is particularly critical for long time base studies for climate change and enabling interoperability and Analysis Ready Data. The proposed TRUTHS (Traceable Radiometry Underpinning Terrestrial and Helio-Studies) mission is explicitly designed to address this issue through re-calibrating itself directly to a primary standard of the international system of units (SI) in-orbit and then through the extension of this SI-traceability to other sensors through in-flight cross-calibration using a selection of Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) recommended test sites. Where the characteristics of the sensor under test allows, this will result in a significant improvement in accuracy. This paper describes a set of tools, algorithms and methodologies that have been developed and used in order to estimate the radiometric uncertainty achievable for an indicative target sensor through in-flight cross-calibration using a well-calibrated hyperspectral SI-traceable reference sensor with observational characteristics such as TRUTHS. In this study, Multi-Spectral Imager (MSI) of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) is evaluated as an example, however the analysis is readily translatable to larger-footprint sensors such as Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). This study considers the criticality of the instrumental and observational characteristics on pixel level reflectance factors, within a defined spatial region of interest (ROI) within the target site. It quantifies the main uncertainty contributors in the spectral, spatial, and temporal domains. The resultant tool will support existing sensor-to-sensor cross-calibration activities carried out under the auspices of CEOS, and is also being used to inform the design specifications for TRUTHS.},

  abstract = {The advancement in satellite remote sensing technology has revolutionised the approaches to monitoring the Earth's surface. The development of the Copernicus Programme by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Union (EU) has contributed to the effective monitoring of the Earth's surface by producing the Sentinel-2 multispectral products. Sentinel-2 satellites are the second constellation of the ESA Sentinel missions and carry onboard multispectral scanners. The primary objective of the Sentinel-2 mission is to provide high resolution satellite data for land cover/use monitoring, climate change and disaster monitoring, as well as complementing the other satellite missions such as Landsat. Since the launch of Sentinel-2 multispectral instruments in 2015, there have been many studies on land cover/use classification which use Sentinel-2 images. However, no review studies have been dedicated to the application of ESA Sentinel-2 land cover/use monitoring. Therefore, this review focuses on two aspects: (1) assessing the contribution of ESA Sentinel-2 to land cover/use classification, and (2) exploring the performance of Sentinel-2 data in different applications (e.g., forest, urban area and natural hazard monitoring). The present review shows that Sentinel-2 has a positive impact on land cover/use monitoring, specifically in monitoring of crop, forests, urban areas, and water resources. The contemporary high adoption and application of Sentinel-2 can be attributed to the higher spatial resolution (10 m) than other medium spatial resolution images, the high temporal resolution of 5 days and the availability of the red-edge bands with multiple applications. The ability to integrate Sentinel-2 data with other remotely sensed data, as part of data analysis, improves the overall accuracy (OA) when working with Sentinel-2 images. The free access policy drives the increasing use of Sentinel-2 data, especially in developing countries where financial resources for the acquisition of remotely sensed data are limited. The literature also shows that the use of Sentinel-2 data produces high accuracies ({$>$}80\%) with machine-learning classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM) and Random forest (RF). However, other classifiers such as maximum likelihood analysis are also common. Although Sentinel-2 offers many opportunities for land cover/use classification, there are challenges which include mismatching with Landsat OLI-8 data, a lack of thermal bands, and the differences in spatial resolution among the bands of Sentinel-2. Sentinel-2 data show promise and have the potential to contribute significantly towards land cover/use monitoring.},

  abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems underpin global water and food security, yet are some of the most endangered ecosystems in the world because they are particularly vulnerable to land management change and climate variability. The US National Research Council's guidance to NASA regarding missions for the coming decade includes a polar orbiting, global mapping hyperspectral satellite remote sensing mission, the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI), to make quantitative measurements of ecosystem change. Traditionally, freshwater ecosystems have been challenging to measure with satellite remote sensing because they are small and spatially complex, require high fidelity spectroradiometry, and are best described with biophysical variables derived from high spectral resolution data. In this study, we evaluate the contribution of a hyperspectral global mapping satellite mission to measuring freshwater ecosystems. We demonstrate the need for such a mission, and evaluate the suitability and gaps, through an examination of the measurement resolution issues impacting freshwater ecosystem measurements (spatial, temporal, spectral and radiometric). These are exemplified through three case studies that use remote sensing to characterize a component of freshwater ecosystems that drive primary productivity. The high radiometric quality proposed for the HyspIRI mission makes it uniquely well designed for measuring freshwater ecosystems accurately at moderate to high spatial resolutions. The spatial and spectral resolutions of the HyspIRI mission are well suited for the retrieval of multiple biophysical variables, such as phycocyanin and chlorophyll-a. The effective temporal resolution is suitable for characterizing growing season wetland phenology in temperate regions, but may not be appropriate for tracking algal bloom dynamics, or ecosystem responses to extreme events in monsoonal regions. Global mapping missions provide the systematic, repeated measurements necessary to measure the drivers of freshwater biodiversity change. Archival global mapping missions with open access and free data policies increase end user uptake globally. Overall, an archival, hyperspectral global mapping mission uniquely meets the measurement requirements of multiple end users for freshwater ecosystem science and management.},

The objectives of this review were to analyze recent advances in water quality remote sensing and determine limitations of current systems, estimation methods, and suggest future improvements. To that end, we collected over 200 sets of water quality data including blue-green algae phycocyanin (BGA-PC), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), dissolved oxygen (DO), specific conductivity (SC), fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM), turbidity, and pollution-sediments from 2016 to 2018. The water quality data, generated from laboratory analysis of grab samples and in-situ real-time monitoring sensors distributed in eight lakes and rivers in Midwestern United States, were paired with synchronous proximal spectra, tripod-mounted hyperspectral imagery, and satellite data. The results showed that both proximal and satellite-based sensors have great potential to provide accurate estimate of optically active parameters, and remote sensing of non-optically active parameters may be indirectly estimated but still remains a challenge. Data-driven empirical approaches, i.e., deep learning outperformed the other competing methods, providing promising possibility for operational use of remote sensing in water quality monitoring and decision-making. As the first-time review of deep neural networks for water quality estimation, the paper concludes that anomaly detection utilizing multi-sensor data fusion and virtual constellation in cloud-computing is the most promising means for predicting impending water pollution outbreaks such as algal blooms.},

  abstract = {Although lakes cover a small fraction of the Earth's surface water, they provide critical ecosystem functions for both human and wildlife. However, with intensive human activities and/or climate changes, water quality of many freshwater lakes has been reported as declining in the past several decades. Considerable efforts have been dedicated in water quality monitoring using remotely sensed imagery; meanwhile the number of satellites has been increased dramatically. Those techniques firstly developed for the ocean applications named ``Ocean color'' were applied to the inland lake water. Unfortunately, the optical properties of the inland waters are much complex than the oceans, where the constituents' compositions, phytoplankton structures, and other optical complexity varies among different water bodies, making it difficult to develop a universal method to retrieval lake water quality parameters using remote sensing. In this chapter, an outline of the basic physics of lake remote sensing and the fundamentals of atmospheric correction are introduced. Then, we discuss some practical remote sensing methods for inland lake studies, including water/land delineation, total suspended sediments (TSS), and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) retrieval algorithms, as well as a novel method to obtain lake bathymetry.},

However, limited water quality records of a full river continuum hindered the understanding of how river systems response to the multiple stressors acting on them. This study highlights the use of Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Imager (MSI) data to monitor changes in water color in two optically complex river systems: the Yangtze and Danube using the Forel-Ule Index (FUI). FUI divides water color into 21 classes from dark blue to yellowish brown stemming from the historical Forel-Ule water color scale and has been promoted as a useful indicator showing water turbidity variations in water bodies. The results revealed contrasting water color patterns in the two rivers on both spatial and seasonal scales. Spatially, the FUI of the Yangtze River gradually increased from the upper reaches to the lower reaches, while the FUI of the Danube River declined in the lower reaches, which is possibly due to the sediment sink effect of the Iron Gate Dams. The regional FUI peaks and valleys observed in the two river systems have also been shown to be related to the dams and hydropower stations along them. Seasonally, the variations of FUI in both systems can be attributed to climate seasonality, especially precipitation in the basin and the water level. Moreover, land cover within the river basin was possibly a significant determinant of water color, as higher levels of vegetation in the Danube basin were associated with lower FUI values, whereas higher FUI values and lower levels of vegetation were observed in the Yangtze system. This study furthers our knowledge of using Sentinel-2 MSI to monitor and understand the spatial-temporal variations of river systems and highlights the capabilities of the FUI in an optically complex environment.},

The Sentinel 2 platform offers greatly improved spatial resolution over other satellite platforms designed for water based chl-a retrievals and includes a ``red-edge'' band at 704 nm not present on the Landsat 8 operational land imager. This study provides validation of an improved version of a well known semi-analytical chl-a retrieval algorithm. The algorithm is provided with several free image processing utilities and the improved approach can be implemented with minimal technology skills. The improved performance is the result of replacing a fixed chl-a specific absorption coefficient (a*) with a variable model. This method was applied to three Sentinel 2 images taken over the Lake Erie western basin correlating with an in-situ dataset of 24 samples where chl-a ranged from 1.89 mg m-3 to 70.20 mg m-3. The variable a* model produced chl-a retrievals with normalised root mean squared error of prediction (NRMSEP) = 7.5\%, bias = -0.47 mg m-3, coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.91 and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) = 0.90). This represented a 23\% reduction in NRMSEP, an 85\% reduction in bias and an increase in NSE of 7\% over the default algorithm using a fixed a* value. Creation of chl-a retrieval algorithms that consider the variability in a* should result in algorithms that perform better against a wide range of chl-a concentrations and are less likely to require local recalibration. Obtaining accurate chl-a retrievals from a satellite platform with the spatial resolution of Sentinel 2 will allow satellite monitoring of many more inland waters than previously possible.},

  abstract = {As important components of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in an aquatic environment, colored DOM (CDOM) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) play an essential role in the carbon cycle of an inland aquatic system. Traditionally, CDOM and DOC in inland waters have been primarily determined using in situ observations and laboratory measurements. Most of past lake investigations on CDOM and DOC focused on easily accessible regions and covered a small fraction of lakes worldwide. To our knowledge, little is known about lakes in less accessible areas like the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). To address this challenge, optical satellite remote sensing might be useful for capturing a synoptic view of CDOM and DOC with high frequency at large scales, complementing in situ sampling methods for inland waters. In this study, 216 samples collected from 36 lakes across the QTP (2014--2017) were examined to determine the relationships between CDOM absorption coefficient at 350 nm (a350) and Sentinel-2A Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) imagery reflectance data. A strong positive linear correlation with a350 was observed with B4/B2 (R2 = 0.78, p {$<$} 0.01) and with B4/B3 (R2 = 0.62). A multi-step regression model was established for estimating a350 with B4/B2 and B4/B3 as input variables (R2 = 0.81, p {$<$} 0.01). A scattered CDOM-DOC relationship was revealed (R2 = 0.34, p {$<$} 0.05) using a pooled dataset. By dividing the inland waters into four separate groups in accordance with their salinity gradients, we were able to develop much stronger relationships (R2 {$>$} 0.8, p {$<$} 0.01) for CDOM-DOC. Significant differences between fresh and saline waters were demonstrated using satellite-derived CDOM and DOC, where high CDOM (0.86 {\textpm} 0.67 m-1) and low DOC (3.76 {\textpm} 4.92 mg L-1) concentrations were observed for freshwaters, while inverse trends of CDOM (0.53 {\textpm} 0.72 m-1) and DOC (15.76 {\textpm} 17.07 mg L-1) were demonstrated for saline lakes in the Tibetan Plateau. This study confirmed that satellite optical imagery can be used for the monitoring of CDOM and DOC of the lakes of the Tibetan Plateau, which are sensitive to a changing climate and are infrequently investigated due to the harsh environment and poor accessibility. Moreover, it highlighted the importance of combining salinity and remote sensing data in the process of estimating lake DOC.},

The most urgent and effective measures rely on dynamic and accurate water quality monitoring on a large scale. Due to their temporal and spatial advantages, remote sensing technologies have been widely used to retrieve water quality data. With the development of hyper-spectral sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and artificial intelligence, there has been significant advancement in remotely sensed water quality retrieval owing to various data availabilities and retrieval methodologies. This article presents the application of remote sensing for water quality retrieval, and mainly discusses the research progress in terms of data sources and retrieval modes. In particular, we summarize some retrieval algorithms for several specific water quality variables, including total suspended matter (TSM), chlorophyll-a (Chl--a), colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). We also discuss the significant challenges to atmospheric correction, remotely sensed data resolution, and retrieval model applicability in the domains of spatial, temporal and water complexity. Finally, we propose possible solutions to these challenges. The review can provide detailed references for future development and research in water quality retrieval.},

   abstract = {During the rainy season the abundance of mosquitoes over the Ferlo region (Senegal) is linked to dynamic, vegetation cover and turbidity of temporary and relatively small ponds. The latter create a variable environment where mosquitoes can thrive and thus contribute to diffusion and transmission of diseases such as the Rift Valley Fever (RVF, with Aedes vexans arabiensis and Culex poicilipes mosquitoes) in the Ferlo. The small size and complex distribution of ponds require the use of high-spatial resolution satellite images for adequate detection. Here the use of SPOT-5 images (10 m-resolution) allows for detailed assessment of spatio-temporal evolution of ponds, through two new indices: i.e., the Normalized Difference Pond Index (NDPI), and the Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI). Small ponds less than 0.5 ha dominate whatever the time period. For example they represent nearly 65% of the total ponds during the peak of the rainy season, up to 90% at the end of the same season. Moreover, another product is proposed: the Zone Potentially Occupied by Mosquitoes (ZPOM). During the apex of the summer monsoon, it is found that RVF mosquitoes occupy 25% of the Ferlo region, while only 0.9% of the same area is covered by ponds. Overlapping areas occupied by grazing cattle and mosquitoes, enhance RVF virus transmission. The remotely sensed operational indices and products presented here are meant to better understand the mechanisms at stake and to contribute to the development of early warning systems in a changing climate and environment. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

NDCI calibration and validation results derived from simulated and MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) datasets show its potential application to widely varying water types and geographic regions. A quadratic function (R 2=0.95, p<0.0001) accurately explained the variance in the simulated data for a chl-a range of 1-60mgm -3. Similarly a twofold calibration and validation of chl-a models using MERIS dataset, (chl-a range: 0.9-28.1mgm -3) yielded R 2 of 0.9, and RMSE of ~2mgm -3 respectively. NDCI was applied on images over the Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay, the Mobile Bay, and the Mississippi River delta region in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The newly developed algorithm was successful in predicting chl-a concentration with approximately 12% overall bias for all above study regions. Findings from this research imply that NDCI can be successfully used on MERIS images to quantitatively monitor chl-a in inland coastal and estuarine waters. In case of remote coastal waters with no ground truth data, NDCI can be used to detect algal bloom and qualitatively infer chl-a concentration ranges very similar to NDVI's application in terrestrial vegetation studies. © 2011.},

We evaluated the performance and applicability of Landsat-8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) images with the four Chl a estimation algorithms. For accuracy, we compared the concentration levels from the four algorithms to those from Worldview-3 (WV3) images. We identified two promising algorithms that could be used alongside L8 and S2 satellite images to monitor Chl a concentrations in Lake Chad. With an averaged R2 of 0.8, the 3BDA and NDCI Chl a algorithms performed accurately with S2 and L8 images. For the S2 and L8 images, 3BDA had the highest performance when compared to the WV3 estimates.

   abstract = {Although lakes cover a small fraction of the Earth’s surface water, they provide critical ecosystem functions for both human and wildlife. However, with intensive human activities and/or climate changes, water quality of many freshwater lakes has been reported as declining in the past several decades. Considerable efforts have been dedicated in water quality monitoring using remotely sensed imagery; meanwhile the number of satellites has been increased dramatically. Those techniques firstly developed for the ocean applications named “Ocean color” were applied to the inland lake water. Unfortunately, the optical properties of the inland waters are much complex than the oceans, where the constituents’ compositions, phytoplankton structures, and other optical complexity varies among different water bodies, making it difficult to develop a universal method to retrieval lake water quality parameters using remote sensing. In this chapter, an outline of the basic physics of lake remote sensing and the fundamentals of atmospheric correction are introduced. Then, we discuss some practical remote sensing methods for inland lake studies, including water/land delineation, total suspended sediments (TSS), and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) retrieval algorithms, as well as a novel method to obtain lake bathymetry.},

   abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The Ocean Color 2 and Dall'Olmo three-band algorithms were used to estimate chlorophyll-a concentration and the calibration of the ratio 490/705 nm was used to produce an algorithm for estimating Secchi disk depth. These algorithms have been calibrated for the Sentinel 2-Multispectral Instrument (S2-MSI) and validated using in situ measurements of chlorophyll-a, Secchi disk depth and radiometry. This data was taken in the Valencia region reservoirs as part of the project Ecological Status of Aquatic Systems with Sentinel Satellites (ESAQS). The results show that for estimating chlorophyll-a concentration, it is better to apply a prior classification based on their trophic status. For eutrophic and hypertrophic waters, the TBDO algorithm had an error of 23 mg/m3 over a chlorophyll-a concentration range of between 10 to 169 mg/m3. For ultraoligotrophic to mesotrophic waters, the better algorithm was OC2_490, which resulted in an error equal to 0.9 mg/m3 over a chlorophyll-a concentration range of between 0.54 to 5.8 mg/m3. For the estimation of water transparency by Secchi disk depth, we have obtained good results with the ratio 490/705 nm, with an error equal to 0.88 m over a Secchi disk depth range of between 0.26 to 8.1 m. These algorithms have been applied to S2-MSI images and satisfactory results have been obtained for different reservoirs in the Valencia region (Spain).},

   abstract = {Water transparency is one of the ecological indicators for describing water quality and the underwater light field which determines its productivity. In the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) as well as in the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) water transparency is used for ecological status classification of inland, coastal and open sea waters and it is regarded as an indicator for eutrophication in Baltic Sea management (HELCOM, 2007). We developed and compared different empirical and semi-analytical algorithms for lakes and coastal Nordic waters to retrieve Secchi depth (ZSD) from remote sensing data (MERIS, 300 m resolution). The algorithms were developed in water bodies with high coloured dissolved organic matter absorption (aCDOM(442) ranging 1.7–4.0 m−1), Chl a concentration (0.5–73 mg m−3) and total suspended matter (0.7–37.5 g m−3) and validated against an independent data set over inland and coastal waters (0.6 m < ZSD < 14.8 m). The results indicate that for empirical algorithms, using longer wavelengths in the visible spectrum as a reference band decreases the RMSE and increases the coefficient of determination (R2). The accuracy increased (R2 = 0.75, RMSE = 1.33 m, n = 134) when ZSD was retrieved via an empirical relationship between ZSD and Kd(490). The best agreement with in situ data was attained when ZSD was calculated via both the diffuse and the beam attenuation coefficient (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.77 m, n = 89). The results demonstrate that transparency can be retrieved with high accuracy over various optical water types by the means of ocean color remote sensing, improving both the spatial and temporal coverage. The satellite derived ZSD product could be therefore used as an additional source of information for WFD and MSFD reporting purposes.},

   abstract = {Transparency or turbidity is one of the main indicators in studies of water quality using remote sensing. Transparency can be measured in situ through the Secchi disc depth (SD), and turbidity using a turbidimeter. In recent decades, different relationships between bands from different remote sensing sensors have been used for the estimation of these variables. In this paper, several indices and spectral bands have been calibrated in order to estimate transparency from Sentinel-2 (S2) images from field data, obtained throughout 2017 and 2018 in Júcar basin reservoirs with a great variety of trophic states. Three atmospheric correction methods developed for waters have been applied to the S2 level L1C images taken at the same day as the field data: Polymer, C2RCC and C2X. From the spectra obtained from S2 and the SD field data, it has been found that the smallest error is obtained with the images atmospherically corrected with Polymer and a potential adjustment of the reflectivities’ ratio of the blue and green bands (R490/R560), which allow the estimation of SD with a relative error of 13%. Also the C2X method presents good adjustment with the same bands ratio, although with a greater error, while the correction C2RCC shows the worst correlation. The relationship between SD (in m) and turbidity (in NTU) has also been obtained, which provides an operational method for estimating turbidity with S2. The relationship for the different reservoirs between SD and chlorophyll-a concentration, suspended solids and dissolved organic matter, is also shown.},

   abstract = {This study investigated the use of frequent metre-scale resolution Pleiades satellite imagery to monitor water quality parameters in the highly turbid Gironde Estuary (GE, SW France). Pleiades satellite data were processed and analyzed in two representative test sites of the GE: 1) the maximum turbidity zone and 2) the mouth of the estuary. The main objectives of this study were to: (i) validate the Dark Spectrum Fitting (DSF) atmospheric correction developed by Vanhellemont and Ruddick (2018) applied to Pleiades satellite data recorded over the GE; (ii) highlight the benefits of frequent metre-scale Pleiades observations in highly turbid estuaries by comparing them to previously validated satellite observations made at medium (250/300 m for MODIS, MERIS, OLCI data) and high (20/30 m for SPOT, OLI and MSI data) spatial resolutions. The results show that the DSF allows for an accurate retrieval of water turbidity by inversion of the water reflectance in the near-infrared (NIR) and red wavebands. The difference between Pleiades-derived turbidity and field measurements was proven to be in the order of 10%. To evaluate the spatial variability of water turbidity at metre scale, Pleiades data at 2 m resolution were resampled to 20 m and 250 m to simulate typical coarser resolution sensors. On average, the derived spatial variability in the GE is lower than or equal to 10% and 26%, respectively, in 20-m and 250-m aggregated pixels. Pleiades products not only show, in great detail, the turbidity features in the estuary and river plume, they also allow to map the turbidity inside ports and capture the complex spatial variations of turbidity along the shores of the estuary. Furthermore, the daily acquisition capabilities may provide additional advantages over other satellite constellations when monitoring highly dynamic estuarine systems.},

L8SR images from 6 March and 17 November 2014 were downloaded from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) website. The algorithm to retrieve turbidity is based on the correlation between L8SR reflectance (single and ratio bands) and insitu data. The b2/b4 and b2/b3 bands ratio are proven to be the best predictors of turbidity, with R2 = 0.560 (p < 0.05) and R2 = 0.726 (p < 0.05) for March and November, respectively. Selected models are validated by comparing the concentrations of predicted and measured turbidity.

   abstract = {Sentinel-2A/MSI (S2A) and Landsat-8/OLI (L8) data products present a new frontier for the assessment and retrieval of optically active water quality parameters including chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), suspended particulate matter (TSS), and turbidity in reservoirs. However, because of their differences in spatial and spectral samplings, it is critical to evaluate how well the sensors are suited for the seamless generation of the water quality parameters (WQPs). This study presents results from the retrieval of the WQP in a reservoir from L8 and S2A optical sensors, after atmospheric correction and standardization through band adjustment. An empirical multivariate regression model (EMRM) algorithmic approach is proposed for the estimation of the water quality parameters in correlation with in situ laboratory measurements. From the results, both sensors estimated Chl-a concentrations with R2 of greater than 70% from the visible green band for L8 and a combination of green and SWIR-1 bands for S2A. While the NMSE% was nearly the same for both sensors in Chl-a estimation, the RMSE was <10 μg/L and >10 μg/L for L8 and S2A estimations of Chl-a, respectively. For TSS retrieval, L8 outperformed S2A by 31% in accuracy with R2>0.9 from L8's red, blue, and green bands, as compared to 0.47≤R2≥0.61 from S2A's red and NIR bands. The RMSE were the same as for Chl-a, and the NMSE% were both in the same range. Both sensors retrieved turbidity with high and nearly equal accuracy of R2>70% from the visible and NIR bands, with equal RMSE at <10% NTU and NMAE% from S2A being higher by more than 30% as compared to L8's NMAE% at 15%. The study concluded that the higher performance accuracy of L8 is attributed to its higher SNR and spectral bandwidth placement as compared to S2A bands. Comparatively, S2A overestimated Chl-a and turbidity but performed equally well compared to OLI in the estimation of TSS. The results show that while absolute accuracy of retrieval of the WQPs still requires improvements, the developed algorithms are broadly able to discern the biooptical water quality in reservoirs.},

We investigated the pattern of turbidity change in the middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River, southern Tibetan Plateau, based on multispectral satellite imagery and in situ measurements. We developed empirical models from in situ measured water leaving reflectance and turbidity, and applied the best performed s-curve models on satellite imagery from Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Landsat 5 to derive turbidity change in 2007–2017. Our results revealed an overall decreasing spatial trend from the upper to lower streams. Seasonal variations were observed with high turbidity from July to September and low turbidity from October to May. Annual turbidity showed a temporally slightly declining trend from 2007 to 2017. The pattern of turbidity change is affected by the confluence of tributaries and the changes in precipitation and vegetation along the river. These findings provide important insights into the responses of riverine turbidity to climate and environmental changes on the Tibetan Plateau.},

Traditional techniques of assessing water quality are typically costly and time-consuming. With the advent of remote sensing technologies and the availability of high-resolution satellite images in recent years, a significant opportunity for water quality monitoring has arisen. In this study, the water quality index (WQI) for the Hudson River has been estimated using Landsat 8 OLI-TIRS images and four Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, such as M5 Model Tree (MT), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Gene Expression Programming (GEP), and Evolutionary Polynomial Regression (EPR). In this way, 13 water quality parameters (WQPs) (i.e., Turbidity, Sulfate, Sodium, Potassium, Hardness, Fluoride, Dissolved Oxygen, Chloride, Arsenic, Alkalinity, pH, Nitrate, and Magnesium) were measured between 14 March 2021 and 16 June 2021 at a site near Poughkeepsie, New York. First, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models were created between these WQPs parameters and the spectral indices of Landsat 8 OLI-TIRS images, and then, the most correlated spectral indices were selected as input variables of AI models. With reference to the measured values of WQPs, the WQI was determined according to the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) guidelines. After that, AI models were developed through the training and testing stages, and then estimated values of WQI were compared to the actual values. The results of the AI models’ performance showed that the MARS model had the best performance among the other AI models for monitoring WQI. The results demonstrated the high effectiveness and power of estimating WQI utilizing a combination of satellite images and artificial intelligence models.},

The accuracy assessment of the estimated turbidity achieved a coefficient of determination (R2) value and root mean square error (RMSE) as high as 0.97 and 1.41 NTU, respectively.

Water turbidity is a reliable and direct indicator that can reflect the water quality. Remote sensing has become an efficient technology for monitoring large-scale water turbidity. This study aims to search an optimal regression model to accurately predict water turbidity using remote sensing data. To achieve this goal, 187 water samples were collected from field campaigns across Northeast China, in 2018, of which the samples were gathered within ±6 days of Sentinel-2 overpasses. The spectral reflectance data was used as independent variables for modeling. The simple regression, partial least squares regression, support vector regression, extreme learning machine, back-propagation neural network, classification and regression tree, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbor were used to compare. From model validation, we identified GBDT as the best regression model (R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 9.90 NTU, MAE = 6.71 NTU). We applied GBDT to retrieve the water turbidity and obtained a satisfactory result. Feature selection technique from tree-based ensemble method was also tested. We selected B2, B3, B4, and B5 as the important variables because of their high ability to explain the variation of turbidity. These results demonstrated the significance of using a promising method to retrieve water turbidity using Sentinel-2 imagery at the regional scale. It is beneficial to monitor the spatial-temporal distribution of water turbidity; support water quality management and inland water environment protection.},

While turbidity is not a direct biochemical indicator of lake water quality, it is relatively easy to measure and indicates trophic status and lake health. Although ocean color satellites have been widely used to monitor water color parameters, their coarse spatial resolution makes it hard to capture the fine spatial variability of turbidity in lakes. The combination of Sentinel-2 and Landsat provides an opportunity to monitor lake turbidity with high spatial and temporal resolution. This study aims to generate consistent turbidity products in Taihu Lake from 2018 to 2022 using the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) on board Sentinel-2A/B and the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on board Landsat-8/9. We first tested the performance of three atmospheric correction methods to retrieve consistent reflectance from MSI and OLI images. We found that the Rayleigh correction and a subtraction of the SWIR band from Rayleigh-corrected reflectance can generate the most consistent reflectance (the coefficient of determination (R2) > 0.84, the mean absolution percentage error (MAPE) < 7%, the median error (ME) < 0.0035, and slope > 0.92). Machine learning models outperformed an existing semi-analytical retrieval algorithm in retrieving turbidity (MSI: R2 = 0.92, MAPE = 18.78%, and OLI: R2 = 0.93, MAPE = 16.20%). The consistency of turbidity from the same-day MSI and OLI images was also satisfactory (N = 3110 and MAPE = 26.48%). The distribution of turbidity exhibited obvious spatial and seasonal variability in Taihu Lake from 2018 to 2022. The results show the potential of MSI and OLI when combined to monitor inland lake water quality.},

   abstract = {With the development of industrialization and urbanization, the consumption and pollution of water resources are becoming more and more serious. Water quality monitoring is an extremely important technical means to protect water resources. However, the current popular water quality monitoring methods have their shortcomings, such as a low signal-to-noise ratio of satellites, poor time continuity of unmanned aerial vehicles, and frequent maintenance of in situ underwater probes. A non-contact near-surface system that can continuously monitor water quality fluctuation is urgently needed. This study proposes an automatic near-surface water quality monitoring system, which can complete the physical equipment construction, data collection, and processing of the application scenario, prove the feasibility of the self-developed equipment and methods and obtain high-performance retrieval results of four water quality parameters, namely chemical oxygen demand (COD), turbidity, ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N), and dissolved oxygen (DO). For each water quality parameter, fourteen machine learning algorithms were compared and evaluated with five assessment indexes. Because the ensemble learning models combine the prediction results of multiple basic learners, they have higher robustness in the prediction of water quality parameters. The optimal determination coefficients ((Formula presented.)) of COD, turbidity, NH3-N, and DO in the test dataset are 0.92, 0.98, 0.95, and 0.91, respectively. The results show the superiority of near-surface remote sensing, which has potential application value in inland, coastal, and various water bodies in the future.},

   abstract = {Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and chlorophyll-a concentration are two critical parameters to monitor water quality. Since directly collecting samples for laboratory analysis can be expensive, this paper presents a methodology to estimate this information through remote sensing and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. TSS and chlorophyll-a are optically active components, therefore enabling measurement by remote sensing. Two study cases in distinct water bodies are performed, and those cases use different spatial resolution data from Sentinel-2 spectral images and unmanned aerial vehicles together with laboratory analysis data. In consonance with the methodology, supervised ML algorithms are trained to predict the concentration of TSS and chlorophyll-a. The predictions are evaluated separately in both study areas, where both TSS and chlorophyll-a models achieved R-squared values above 0.8.},

   abstract = {La cuantificación de parámetros fisicoquímicos y microbiológicos es fundamental para definir la calidad del agua, pero el entendimiento de las relaciones y el comportamiento de estos parámetros, contribuyen a definir el estado trófico y calidad ambiental de los ecosistemas acuáticos. En este contexto, el objetivo del estudio fue determinar las relaciones entre los parámetros fisicoquímicos y microbiológicos del agua de la bahía interior del lago Titicaca en la ciudad de Puno-Perú, aplicando la técnica de árboles de predicción de aprendizaje automático. La muestra estuvo constituida por 17 parámetros de calidad, que fueron medidos mensualmente durante enero de 2013 y abril de 2019, obteniéndose un total de 76 datos por cada parámetro. Para la elaboración de los árboles de predicción y su posterior interpretación, se utilizó el paquete estadístico R. Se evidenció que los parámetros fisicoquímicos preponderantes del lago Titicaca, son temperatura, oxígeno disuelto, potencial de hidrógeno, conductividad eléctrica, sólidos suspendidos totales, clorofila-a, demanda bioquímica de oxígeno, demanda química de oxígeno y transparencia, a partir de los cuales se aplicó la técnica de árboles de predicción y se comprobó la eficiencia de estos modelos estadístico en la predicción de dichos parámetros para realizar estimaciones, teniendo en cuenta las características del lugar donde se utilice.},

   abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) algorithms provide an alternative for the prediction of pollutant concentration. We compared eight ML algorithms (Linear Regression (LR), uniform weighting k-Nearest Neighbor (UW-kNN), variable weighting k-Nearest Neighbor (VW-kNN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Regression Tree (RT), Random Forest (RF), and Adaptive Boosting (AdB)) to evaluate the feasibility of ML approaches for estimation of Total Suspended Solids (TSS) using the national stormwater quality database. Six factors were used as features to train the algorithms with TSS concentration as the target parameter: Drainage area, land use, percent of imperviousness, rainfall depth, runoff volume, and antecedent dry days. Comparisons among the ML methods demonstrated a higher degree of variability in model performance, with the coefficient of determination (R2 ) and Nash–Sutcliffe (NSE) values ranging from 0.15 to 0.77. The Root Mean Square (RMSE) values ranged from 110 mg/L to 220 mg/L. The best fit was obtained using the AdB and RF models, with R2 values of 0.77 and 0.74 in the training step and 0.67 and 0.64 in the prediction step. The NSE values were 0.76 and 0.72 in the training step and 0.67 and 0.62 in the prediction step. The predictions from AdB were sensitive to all six factors. However, the sensitivity level was variable.},
